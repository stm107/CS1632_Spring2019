  # just as if we were adding a real node, but we are looking at it

  # Even if id on node does not work, graph - the
  # actual code under test - can still be tested!

  # make a big differentiation between mocks and doubles.  But

  # does verification ("expects" calls)

    # .add_node method, it will actually call our stub

  # This is where we can use a mock.
